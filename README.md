“DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A SEQUENCE GENERATOR”
A sequence generator is a  digital logic circuit whose purpose is to produce a prescribed sequence of outputs. Each output will be one of a number of symbols or of binary logic levels. The sequence may be of indefinite length or of predetermined fixed length. A binary counter is a special type of sequence generator. Sequence generators are useful in a wide variety of coding and control applications. Sequence generators are nothing but a set of digital circuits which are designed to result in a specific bit sequence at their output. There are several ways in which these circuits can be designed including those which are based on multiplexers and flip-flops. 

In our project, we constructed a four bit sequence generator using four registers s0, s1, s2 and s3. S0 stores the XOR of s1 and s3, while the output which gets printed on the console is s3. The output is fed back to the circuit to create a sequence.
